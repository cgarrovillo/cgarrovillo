## Hi there üëã

I'm Christian, a full-stack developer, ReactJS fan, tech-guy, car-guy, with a self-proclaimed entrepreneurial mindset and a good eye for design. I try to put my best efforts into my work, even if it's just a "side-project" in the off-chance it unicorns üöÄüëÄ.  If you'd like to learn more, checkout my [website](https://christiang.dev).

Working at [Connectus Global](https://connectusglobal.com) as a Full-Stack Developer.

 - Am working on a platform for car-people. Soon!
 - Am working on a platform for retail workers to get your email without a single "huh?". Soon!
 - Try to support an [open-source project](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/ohpwna/has_someone_written_an_extensive_book_on_the/) related to Canada's Housing Market.
 - Think about starting yet another side-project and forgetting the others

### üèõ And In the past I've...
