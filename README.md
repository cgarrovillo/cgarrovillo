## Hi there üëã

I'm Christian, a full-stack developer, ReactJS fan, tech-guy, car-guy, with a self-proclaimed entrepreneurial mindset and a (also self-proclaimed) good eye for design. I try to put my best efforts into my work, even if it's just a "side-project" in the off-chance it unicorns üöÄüëÄ.  If you'd like to learn more about those projects, checkout my [website](https://christiang.dev).

### ‚òïÔ∏è My day-to-day right now is...
Working at [Connectus Global](https://connectusglobal.com) as a Full-Stack Developer.

**Normally work on these but these are on hold due to a more important task I'm working hard on. üòÅü§´** 

 - ~~Am working on a platform for car-enthusiasts to connect~~
 - ~~Am working on a platform for friends to more easily share paid services.~~
 - ~~Am working on a platform for retail workers to get your email without a single "huh?" in the process.~~
 - ~~Try to support an [open-source project](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/ohpwna/has_someone_written_an_extensive_book_on_the/) related to Canada's Housing Market.~~
 - [Think about starting yet another side-project and forgetting the others](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6688713/126884834-8b3bbf96-5e90-4207-8eb3-ecf07c91a291.png)

### üèõ And In the past I've...
 - Worked on a COVID health screening checkup platform for daycares & gyms via [HomeHow Mortgage](https://www.linkedin.com/company/homehow/about/).
 - Worked on a backend API for a "SkipTheDishes" for food trucks, concessions, golf houses via [HomeHow Mortgage](https://www.linkedin.com/company/homehow/about/).
