## Hi there 👋

I'm Christian, a full-stack developer, ReactJS fan, tech-guy, car-guy, with a self-proclaimed entrepreneurial mindset and a good eye for design. I try to put my best efforts into my work, even if it's just a "side-project" in the off-chance it unicorns 🚀👀.  If you'd like to learn more, checkout my [website](https://christiang.dev).

### ☕️ My day-to-day right now is...
Working at [Connectus Global](https://connectusglobal.com) as a Full-Stack Developer.

<h2></h2>

### 🌳 But when I'm bored I...
 - Am working on a platform for car-people. Soon!
 - Am working on a platform for retail workers to get your email without a single "huh?". Soon!
 - Try to support an [open-source project](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/ohpwna/has_someone_written_an_extensive_book_on_the/) related to Canada's Housing Market.
 - Think about starting yet another side-project and forgetting the others

<h2></h2>

### 🏛 And In the past I've...
 - Worked on a COVID health screening checkup platform for daycares & gyms via [HomeHow Mortgage](https://www.linkedin.com/company/homehow/about/).
 - Worked on a backend API for a "SkipTheDishes" for food trucks, concessions, golf houses via [HomeHow Mortgage](https://www.linkedin.com/company/homehow/about/).
 - Joined a wonderful team helping non-profits with free software development from student volunteers via [codethechangeyyc](https://codethechangeyyc.ca)
